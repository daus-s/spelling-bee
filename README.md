Happy birthday Anna! Don't use this unless you're really stuck :)

## Abstract
This repository contains the code used to solve the 'Spelling Bee' game from [NYT games](https://www.nytimes.com/games/). It is built using a simple filter function on two lists of words, valid English words and a list provided by Apple on MacOS. The valid English list referred to as `dict` and was generated by pinging [dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). 

## Instructions
- Download [`package.zip`](https://github.com/daus-s/spelling-bee/raw/main/package.zip)
  - This contains the directory with source, resources, and templates and executable files necesary to run this program.
    ```

      **Figure 3.** Output of the previous commands.
  - Run the installer script via `./installer.sh`
    - If this error: `-bash: ./installer.sh: Permission denied`, is generated run: `chmod +x installer.sh`
    - This file has been chmod'ed already

- This has put the `Spelling Bee.app` in the Applications folder and will be runnable via the shortcut in the Launchpad.
