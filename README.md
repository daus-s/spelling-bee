Happy birthday Anna! Don't use this unless you're really stuck :)

## Abstract
This repository contains the code used to solve the 'Spelling Bee' game from [NYT games](https://www.nytimes.com/games/). It is built using a simple filter function on two lists of words, valid English words and a list provided by Apple on MacOS. The valid English list referred to as `dict` and was generated by pinging [dictionaryapi.dev](https://dictionaryapi.dev/). An installer, app package, and all system requirements are provided.

## Instructions
- Download [`package.zip`](https://github.com/daus-s/spelling-bee/raw/main/package.zip)
  - This contains the directory with source, resources, and templates and executable files necesary to run this program.
    ```

- Extract zip file via CLI or in Finder
  - ##### Finder
    - Extract the zip file using the default zip utility built into MacOS.

  - ##### Terminal/CLI
    - Run the command
      - `$ unzip -q package.zip` **-q** is used to silence the extraction.
      - Ensure you are in the correct directory where the package file is. To move this directory somewhere else run `mv ~/Downloads/spelling-bee.zip <desired_directory_location>`. **Note:** this is now unnecessary as the installer uses the same pattern in installing and is not user-dependent.

- Run the installer script
  - Navigate into the package directory.
    - `user$ cd ~/Downloads/spelling-bee/package/`
    - `user$ ls`

      **Figure 3.** Output of the previous commands.
  - Run the installer script via `./installer.sh`
    - If this error: `-bash: ./installer.sh: Permission denied`, is generated run: `chmod +x installer.sh`
    - This file has been chmod'ed already

- This has put the `Spelling Bee.app` in the Applications folder and will be runnable via the shortcut in the Launchpad. The program files will be located in the folder `~/` on MacOS, which is `/Users/<yourname>/`. 
## Technologies Used
This project was mainly built using Python, HTML, and CSS. The framework used to build the app itself is Flask. The app is run via an Apple Auttomator app. Each component of this project had intentionality in the technology used. While seemingly meaningless, the reason Flask is used is that early versions of the App would ping [dictionaryapi.dev](dictionaryapi.dev). Flask has very strong compatibility with API calls. This is likely to be changed in future updates to help with the ease of use. Frameworks like TKinter will likely replace the browser-based application as there is no more reliance on any API calls. The HTML and CSS are basic web tools, there are no external libraries employed outside of the Google fonts used for the website.
## Issues dealt with
### Control Port 5000
In early development, the app would not be returned on the port although there were no issues from the Flask server's side. This turned out to be because of a choice of both Apple and the Flask developers to assign port 5000.

'Port 5000 is now used for Airplay as well as port 7000 as of macOS Monterey. So yes, it's normal ! Apple decided to use those ports even though a lot of developers use those ports by default.' -[tama](https://apple.stackexchange.com/users/396787/tama)
```
$ export YOURAPPLICATION_SETTINGS=/path/to/settings.cfg
$ flask run
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
```
-[Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/config/)

This issue was not immediately apparent. Sometimes, the server would load the Flask app other times it would return an access denied 403 response code. It was not until finding that ports 5000 and 7000 are used by MacOS was the  app able to be  run consistently.
#### Solution
A random numbered port was chosen that was not assigned according to the entirely comprehensive list on Wikipedia /s.

Port No.
4174

### Checking Words against a 'more correct' list
There are many words in the list that Apple has on disk that match the requirements of NYT Games Spelling Bee but are not considered to be words in their word list. The first iterations were using longer and longer prompts on ChatGPT, however, this proved inefficient and not rigourous. As Alexander Kurz says "if you need to be right 100% of the time you must use math; 1% wrong in one million is still a lot." The ext solution was to not remove any assuming NYT Games list was a subset of `/usr/shared/dict/words/` (which b.t.w. exists on all Macs if you ever need a set of all words)
